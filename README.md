NetMQ
=====

NetMQ is port of zeromq to .net, the project based on zeromq version 3.2.

NetMQ is lightweight messaginglibrary which extends the
standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by
specialised messaging middleware products. NetMQ sockets provide an
abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns,
message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport
protocols and more.

NetMQ is still under development, although the current repository is pretty stable.
